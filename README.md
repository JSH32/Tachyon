# Tachyon
My personal QoL and performance minecraft modpack. This contains all my presets. Older versions will (probably) not be updated and are kept for archival purposes.

This is built with packwiz which allows for auto-updating modpacks (in MultiMC format).

## Building
1. Download [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)
2. Download python
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install python dependencies.
4. Run `python build.py`
